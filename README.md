test github pages

site autamaticly upload from repository after some minutes, so quick changes will show after this time

this is good guide to start work: https://evanwill.github.io/go-go-ghpages/2-basic.html
and in the link we can see:
> All Markdown files in the repo will also be rendered to HTML using the default GitHub theme. If there is an index.md or index.html it will be served as the index page, otherwise README.md will be.

also good site for simle images: https://dummyimage.com/
also good site to start work with jekyll: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/

jekyll is a good choose for creating and upgrading site hosted on git-pages.
